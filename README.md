# Remote Work Impact Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on the trends and impacts of remote work. Using demographic, occupational, and industry-specific data, this project examines various factors influencing telework participation, such as age, gender, education, job type, and employment status. The project provides insights into the patterns of remote work engagement across different sectors, helping to understand which groups telework the most and the distribution of telework hours among full-time and part-time workers.

## Project Structure

- **Remote_Work_Impact_Analysis.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file that contains the data processing, analysis, and visualization for the study. It includes:
  - Data loading and cleaning steps
  - Exploratory analysis of demographic and occupational factors in telework participation
  - Visualization of key insights into telework trends across various industries
  - Conclusions based on the analysis

## Research Questions

The project addresses the following key questions:

1. Are certain demographic groups more likely to telework?
2. What is the correlation between weekly telework hours and age?
3. Which job categories and industries have the highest telework participation?
4. How does industry impact telework participation and hours?
5. Are full-time employees more likely to telework than part-time employees?
6. What is the distribution of telework hours among full-time and part-time workers?

## Key Insights

The analysis found that telework participation rates are higher among individuals with advanced degrees, certain mid-career age groups, and in knowledge-driven job categories. Industries such as Finance, Insurance, and Professional Services also exhibit higher telework rates. Conversely, roles requiring physical presence, particularly in Food Services, Construction, and Hospitality, show low telework rates. Full-time employees are more likely to telework than part-time employees, and they tend to log more weekly telework hours.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abd-abdur/Remote_Work_Impact_Analysis.git
   
2.  **Open `Remote_Work_Impact_Analysis.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3.  **Run the notebook** to see the analysis results.
   
## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

Install the required libraries using: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


## Usage

The analysis notebook can be used to explore telework trends across various dimensions and adapt the insights for organizational policy-making or HR research purposes. Simply run each cell in the notebook to reproduce the visuals and findings.
